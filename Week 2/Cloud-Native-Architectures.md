Cloud Native Microservices is an approach to software development where an application is broken down into small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each microservice is developed, tested, and deployed independently, allowing for greater flexibility and agility in the development process.

Cloud Native Microservices are designed to run on cloud platforms and are characterized by being:
- Loosely coupled: Each microservice is designed to be independent and decoupled from other microservices, enabling developers to modify or replace them without impacting the rest of the application.
- Containerized: Each microservice is packaged as a container, which provides a lightweight and portable runtime environment that can be easily deployed and managed.
- Scalable: Cloud Native Microservices are designed to be horizontally scalable, meaning that additional instances of the same microservice can be created as demand increases.
- Resilient: Cloud Native Microservices are designed to be resilient, meaning that they are able to recover quickly from failures and minimize downtime.
- Automated: The deployment and management of Cloud Native Microservices are automated using tools like Kubernetes, which enables developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure.

Cloud Native Microservices provide a number of benefits, including increased agility, scalability, and resilience. They also enable organizations to adopt a DevOps approach to software development and delivery, allowing for faster time-to-market and continuous delivery.

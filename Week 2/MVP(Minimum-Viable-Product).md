Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a version of a product or service that includes only the core features and functions required to solve the primary problem or meet the main needs of the target audience.

The concept of an MVP is commonly used in the product development process, particularly in the context of startups and entrepreneurs, where the goal is to quickly develop and launch a product that can be tested in the market to gauge demand and receive feedback from customers. By focusing on the most important features and minimizing the time and resources required to build the product, an MVP allows companies to test their assumptions about their target market, identify areas for improvement, and validate their business model before investing further resources.

Once an MVP is launched and feedback is received, the company can use this information to iterate and improve upon the product, adding additional features and functionality over time. The ultimate goal is to create a product that fully meets the needs of the target audience, while minimizing development costs and maximizing return on investment.

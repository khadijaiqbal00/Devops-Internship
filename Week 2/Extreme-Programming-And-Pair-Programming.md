What is Extreme Programming Framework ?
Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development framework that is based on the Agile methodology. XP emphasizes collaboration, feedback, and continuous improvement, and it is designed to help development teams deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently.
XP is built around several core practices, including:
- Pair programming: Two developers work together on a single task, with one developer coding while the other reviews and provides feedback.
- Test-driven development (TDD): Developers write automated tests before writing any code, using the tests to guide their development process.
- Continuous integration (CI): Developers integrate their code changes frequently, often multiple times per day, to ensure that the codebase remains stable and functional.
- Refactoring: Developers continuously review and improve their code, making changes to improve its readability, maintainability, and performance.
- Small releases: Developers release working software frequently, often in small increments, to gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
